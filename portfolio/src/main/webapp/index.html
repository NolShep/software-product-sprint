      <p>About me: </p>
      <p>Hello! My name is Nolan and I hope you 
         like my website. I'm a sophomore at Syracuse University studying
         CS and I love coding. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends,
         cooking, and playing various sports such as football, basketball,
         spikeball and soccer. </p>
